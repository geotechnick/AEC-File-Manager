## ⚡ Batch Files Included

| File | What It Does | When to Use |
|------|--------------|-------------|

## 🎯 Smart File Organization

The organizer automatically sorts files by type and content:

### Drawings & CAD Files:
- **PDFs with drawing patterns** → `02_DRAWINGS/Current_Issue/`
- **DWG/DXF files** → `02_DRAWINGS/Current_Issue/`
- **BIM files (RVT, IFC)** → `08_MODELS_CAD/BIM_Models/`

### Documents:
- **Specifications** → `03_SPECIFICATIONS/`
- **Calculations** → `04_CALCULATIONS/`
- **Reports** → `05_REPORTS/`
- **Office docs** → `00_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/`

### Media:
- **Photos/Images** → `07_SITE_DOCUMENTATION/Photos/`
- **Videos** → `07_SITE_DOCUMENTATION/Video_Documentation/`

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### Smart Pattern Recognition:
The system recognizes standard AEC file naming patterns:
- `CD_A_DWG_001_R3_031524.pdf` → Architectural drawing
- `DD_S_CALC_BEAM_R2_022024.pdf` → Structural calculation
- `PD_G_RPT_GEOTECH_R0_011024.pdf` → Geotechnical report

### Safe Operation:
- **Files are COPIED, not moved** - originals stay safe
- **No file deletion** - everything is preserved
- **Works on any Windows computer** - no special software needed

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### File Safety:
✅ **Your files are never deleted or moved permanently**  
✅ **Everything is copied to organized locations**  
✅ **Original files remain exactly where they were**  

### After Organization:
1. **Review the organized files** in their new locations
2. **Delete originals only after confirming** copies are correct
3. **Keep backups** of important projects

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error:
- **Right-click** the batch file
- **Select "Run as administrator"**
- **Try again**

### Files Not Organizing:
- **Check file names** - system works best with standard AEC naming
- **Move files manually** if automatic sorting isn't perfect
- **Use descriptive filenames** for better auto-sorting

### Script Won't Run:
- **Make sure you extracted the ZIP file** completely
- **Check that files aren't "blocked"** by Windows security
- **Try running from a different location** (like Desktop)
