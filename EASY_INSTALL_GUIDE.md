1. **Go to**: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. **Click the big yellow button** that says "Download Python 3.x.x"
3. **Wait for download** (it's about 25MB - like downloading 5-6 photos)

### Install Python:
1. **Find the file** you just downloaded (usually in your Downloads folder)
2. **Double-click** the file to start installation
3. **IMPORTANT**: ‚úÖ Check the box "Add Python to PATH" at the bottom
4. **Click "Install Now"**
5. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for installation to complete
6. **Click "Close"** when finished

> üí° **Why Python?** Many professional tools use Python because it's reliable and safe. It won't harm your computer.

## üéØ Using AEC File Manager (Super Easy!)

### For Your First Project:

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell** (Windows key + R, type "cmd", press Enter)
2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   ```
   cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Project\Folder"
   ```
   (Replace with your actual project path)

3. **Set up your project** (creates all the folders automatically):
   ```
   aec
   ```
   That's it! Just type "aec" and it does everything automatically!

4. **Scan your files**:
   ```
   aec scan
   ```

5. **Get a beautiful report**:
   ```
   aec report
   ```

### Even Easier: Use the Folder Path

Instead of navigating, you can tell the program exactly where your project is:

```
aec init "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Project 2024"
aec scan "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Project 2024"
```
