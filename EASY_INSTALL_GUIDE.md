## üéØ Using AEC File Manager (Super Easy!)

### For Your First Project:

1. **Open Command Prompt or PowerShell** (Windows key + R, type "cmd", press Enter)
2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   ```
   cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Project\Folder"
   ```
   (Replace with your actual project path)

3. **Set up your project** (creates all the folders automatically):
   ```
   aec
   ```
   That's it! Just type "aec" and it does everything automatically!

4. **Scan your files**:
   ```
   aec scan
   ```

5. **Get a beautiful report**:
   ```
   aec report
   ```

### Even Easier: Use the Folder Path

Instead of navigating, you can tell the program exactly where your project is:

```
aec init "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Project 2024"
aec scan "C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Project 2024"
```
